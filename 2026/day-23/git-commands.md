## Tips & Points to Remember

- Use `git status` frequently. It's your guide to knowing what's happening.
- Commit often, but keep commits focused (“one logical change per commit”).
- Write clear commit messages — they help you and your collaborators.
- Use `git log --oneline` for a quick, readable history.
- Don't delete the `.git/` folder unless you intend to remove all version control!
- If unsure about what will be committed, run `git diff` or `git diff --cached`.
- Prefer `git switch` for branch changes—it’s friendlier than `git checkout`.
- Always push new branches with `git push -u origin <branch>`.
- Remove local branches you no longer need to keep your repo tidy.
- Use upstream remote to sync your fork with the original project.

**Tip:**  
Never delete the `.git/` directory unless you want to remove git tracking and HISTORY from your project!
