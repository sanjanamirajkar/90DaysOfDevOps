# My 90 Days DevOps Roadmap

### My Current Level :
I am currently at a beginner level in DevOps with a basic understanding of core DevOps concepts,
and I am actively building on this foundation step by step. I have recently joined the Train With Shubham (Josh batch 10) class,
where I am exploring DevOps in a structured manner through consistent learning and hands-on practice.
I am fully committed to this 90-days journey, and with discipline, practice, and the right guidance,
my goal is to gain strong command over DevOps fundamentals and real-world workflows.

### My Understanding of DevOps & Cloud :
DevOps is a combination of development and operations that focuses on automation, collaboration, and continuous delivery.
Cloud provides scalable infrastructure where applications can be deployed, managed, and monitored efficiently.

### Why I Am Learning DevOps & Cloud :
I am learning DevOps to build a strong technical career, gain real-world skills, and become job-ready.
I want to understand how modern applications are deployed, automated, and maintained in production environments.

### Where I Want to Reach :
My goal is to become a confident DevOps Engineer. I want to gain hands-on experience with all core DevOps skills and 
tools by learning and practicing them consistently. I aim to master real-world DevOps workflows and become completely job-ready.

### My 90-Days Goals :
* To build strong fundamentals in Linux, and scripting in python and shell scripting and confidently work with the command line.
* To gain hands-on experience with AWS, Azure and GCP cloud and understand real-world infrastructure.
* To build and understand CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins and GitHub Actions.
* To become confident in using Git and GitHub for version control and collaboration.
* To containerize applications using Docker and Kubernetes and understand container concepts clearly.
* To automate infrastructure using Terraform and Ansible.
* To understand basic monitoring and logging using Grafana and Prometheus.

### Core DevOps Skills I Want to Build :
- Linux administration and troubleshooting
- CI/CD pipelines and Automation
- Containerization with Docker and Kubernetes
  
### How I Will Stay Consistent :
- Follow a daily learning schedule
- Practice hands-on labs regularly
- Track progress and learn in public by sharing updates on LinkedIn
- My Weekly Time Commitment :
- Weekdays: 4-5 hours per day.
- Weekends: 1-2 hours for practice and revision
  
### My Commitment
I am committed to staying consistent for the next 90 days and focusing on learning with discipline and dedication.
